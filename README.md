# SIMON_GAME
Simon is a classic electronic game that requires players to repeat a sequence of flashing lights and sounds. In this project, we will build a web version of the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game board will consist of four colored buttons, each with a unique sound. The game will randomly generate a sequence of button presses, and the player must repeat the sequence correctly to progress to the next level. The game will keep track of the player's score and the current level.

Here's an overview of the steps required to build the Simon game:

Create a basic HTML layout for the game board, including the four colored buttons and a scoreboard.

Style the game board using CSS, including the color and layout of the buttons, the font style and size of the scoreboard, and any other visual elements you want to include.
Write JavaScript code to handle the game logic, including generating a random sequence of button presses, playing the corresponding sounds, and checking the player's input against the correct sequence.
event listeners to the buttons to detect when the player clicks on them and record their input.
Display feedback to the player when they make a mistake, such as flashing the correct sequence again or displaying an error message.
Implement multiple levels of difficulty, such as increasing the length of the sequence or decreasing the time the player has to respond.
Finally, add any additional features you want to include, such as high scores or different game modes.
By following these steps, you can create a fun and challenging web version of the Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
